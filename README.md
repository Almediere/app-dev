# My Favorite KDrama:


## Weak Hero Class
Yeon Si-eun is among the top 1% of students in his class and is not interested in anything except studying. Though physically weak, he does not back down from the bullies in his classroom led by Jeon Yeong-bin. Using his quick decision-making skills, knowledge of multiple subjects, and the objects in his surroundings, Si-eun protects himself from their escalating acts of violence. But when he gets in grave danger, he receives help from Ahn Su-ho, the strongest fighter in their class, and Oh Beom-seok, the tormented son of an assemblyman. The three become friends as they try to survive a high school life full of violence and learn what it truly means to be strong.
